## Introduction

You‚Äôll see examples of Markdown, HTML, and JavaScript all working together.

Below is an example of an HTML table and list .

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>SECOND</td>
      <td>This is one sentence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>THIRD</td>
      <td>This is a sentence about something else.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>FOURTH</td>
      <td>And then another one.</td>
